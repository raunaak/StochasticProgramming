# StochasticProgramming
This contains code for many different stochastic models that we learnt in our project at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi under the supervision of Prof Vikas Vikram Singh (https://sites.google.com/site/vikassinghiitd/home). 
Steps to replicate our analysis: 
1. Run Data/quandl.py to obtain data.
2. Run Data/return_series.py and variance_matrix.py to obtain return and variance matrix.
3. Run Data/markowitz_curve.py to obtain markowitz_curve.py.
4. Run all the models 1 - 5 in StaticModels folder with different parameters. For verification of results, we have added project report and StochasticProgrammingFinal.pptx.
5. Run Bender's decomposition algorithm in bender folder for 2 stage problem. Input files are also appended.
6. Run all the models 8 - 10 in MultiStage folder. For verification of results, we have added project report and StochasticProgrammingFinal.pptx.
7. Generate testing data from Data/quandl.py and obtain.
